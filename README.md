## Knights Travails
A project inspired by the Odin Project 

A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any other square on the board, given enough turns.

Assignment is to build a function knightMoves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
